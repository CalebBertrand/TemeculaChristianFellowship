                    <strong>The Bible is Gods Word</strong><br>
                    God selected certain men in history to write down His Words and His thoughts. Because God is perfect we believe the
                    Bible in its original manuscript is perfect. We believe that God speaks today by the power of His Holy Spirit
                    through
                    His Word in a way that is relevant to our lives. <br><br>

                    <strong>There is only one true God and He eternally exists in three persons:</strong><br>
                    God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. <br><br>

                    <strong>Jesus Christ is God</strong><br>
                    He was born to a virgin, lived a sinless life, died a substitutionary death, was resurrected
                    on
                    the third day and eventually ascended to Heaven where He forever intercedes as High Priest on our behalf. <br><br>

                    <strong>After His ascension to Heaven, Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to the earth</strong><br>
                    While on earth, the Holy Spirit draws men
                    and
                    women to repentance of sin, regenerates our hearts to salvation, seals us until the day of redemption, and equips
                    and
                    empowers us to live godly and fruitful lives. The Holy Spirit also gives us special gifts for service and the
                    edification of believers. We believe it is the privilege and responsibility of every believer to minister in love
                    according to the gifts and grace of God. <br><br>

                    <strong>Salvation is God’s free gift to mankind</strong><br>
                    Because we were dead in our sins, God sent His son Jesus to come to this
                    earth
                    and die on a cross. He took our place, paid our debts and forgave our sins so that those who believe on Him and
                    confess
                    His Lordship will be right with God, what the Bible calls “righteous”. <br><br>

                    <strong>Life continues after physical death and there is a heaven and a hell</strong><br>
                    Those who have been saved by His Grace will
                    resurrect to an eternal life with God and the rest to eternal punishment and separation from God. <br><br>

                    <strong>Jesus Christ will return</strong><br>
                    Jesus will return personally and visibly to earth and establish His kingdom.
